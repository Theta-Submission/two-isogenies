# An Algorithmic Approach to (2, 2)-isogenies in the Theta Model

Code accompanying the research paper: An Algorithmic Approach to (2, 2)-isogenies in the Theta Model and Applications to Isogeny-based Cryptography, prepared for submission to ASIACRYPT.

This repository contains both a constant time implementation in Rust and an alternative implementation for SageMath. For further details and usage examples, see the respective `README.md` in the sub-directories `Theta-Rust` and `Theta-SageMath`.
